# MODX 3 fork notes

- Added CLI-only headless install/update (`_build/install.headless.php`) as the recommended MODX 3 deployment path: no Package Manager record and no manager menu are created; files, namespace, settings, token and cache refresh are handled directly.
The `modx3` branch ports modxMCP 1.9.0 to native MODX Revolution 3 APIs while keeping the MCP action surface compatible.

- Native MODX 3 bootstrap via Composer and `modX::getInstance()`.
- Core MODX/xPDO model identifiers use FQCN class constants instead of MODX 2 aliases.
- Core processors are resolved to exact MODX 3 PSR-4 classes, including compound names such as `GetList`, `EmptyRecycleBin`, `RefreshUris`, `TemplateVar`, and `PackageNamespace`.
- Missing `Security/Group/Get` route replaced with direct xPDO lookup.
- Legacy model class names supplied at API boundaries are normalized to MODX 3 FQCNs.
- MODX 3 media-source folder deletion uses relative paths as required since MODX 3.
- Manager processors/controllers and transport build/install code use namespaced MODX 3 classes.
- Transport package is named `modxMCP3` while retaining the `modxmcp` component namespace.
- Processor compatibility is checked against MODX `v3.2.2-pl` and current `3.x`.

# Changelog

## 1.9.0 (2026-08-10)

- **`dependency_graph`** — a structural map of how the site's elements wire together: which
  template pulls which chunk/snippet/TV, which snippet renders which chunk, where each TV is
  attached. Returns `nodes` + `edges` (`[from, to, kind]`) and, for free, two things a text
  search cannot give: **`missing`** (tags pointing at a chunk/snippet that does not exist —
  genuinely broken references) and **`orphans`** (elements nothing references — dead code).
  References are detected in MODX tags, chunk-valued properties — inline `&tpl=`…`, an element's
  **default properties** and **named property sets** (miniShop2 wires `msProducts` →
  `tpl.msProducts.row` there, not in any content) — `$modx->getChunk()`/`runSnippet()` in PHP,
  MIGX `inputTV`/`renderchunktpl`, `@CHUNK` bindings and the template↔TV relation. Chunks used
  by something that isn't an element (a system setting, a miniShop2 order-status e-mail, which
  references chunks by id) get a `used_by` field and are never called orphans. `focus`/`depth`/`direction` return just the neighbourhood of one
  element — precise where `find_usages` is a substring match — and `format:"summary"` is a
  cheap site health check. Token-safe by the same rule as `project_overview`: it scales with
  the element count, never with content (resources are counts, not nodes). Orphan candidates
  are cross-checked against resource content so a chunk pasted into a page isn't falsely
  listed (auto-skipped above 5000 resources; `stats.orphans_verified` says which). Read-only:
  static elements are read via `getFileContent()`, avoiding the re-save `getContent()` can
  trigger. New `graph` help topic; `getting_started`/`index` updated to route to it.
- **Visual graph on its own manager screen** — Components → modxMCP → «Граф связей» (a second
  menu item and manager action, `?a=graph&namespace=modxmcp`; the settings page links to it and
  is otherwise unchanged). Three layouts, because one undifferentiated hairball is unreadable:
  **Слои** (default — each type gets its own horizontal row, in the manager's own tree order:
  resources, then templates, TVs, chunks, snippets, plugins, with tinted bands and sticky row
  headers), **Кластеры** (each type pulled into its own cloud) and **Свободно** (pure force).
  Full-height force-directed map with arrows showing direction of use,
  nodes sized by reference count, hover-to-highlight, drag/zoom/pan, type filters with counts,
  a search box with results, clickable sidebar lists of broken references and unused elements,
  and a details card (category, degrees, `used_by`, incoming/outgoing lists, edit link).
  Filters for the two kinds of noise that drown a real site: **hide vendor elements** (nodes
  carry a `vendor` flag — their category, or their name, matches an installed add-on namespace;
  on a stock install that is ~60% of the graph) and **hide unused**. Plus a density slider,
  since the useful spacing depends on how big the site is.
  The central interaction is **isolation**: double-click a node to show only its neighbourhood,
  with 1–3 hop depth and an uses / used-by switch — that is the "what breaks if I touch this"
  view. Broken references render as hollow red nodes, orphans get a dashed halo. Repulsion uses
  a uniform grid so large sites stay interactive. No external libraries (the manager ships none
  and the transport package stays self-contained). The screen and the MCP action share ONE
  builder, so what the owner sees and what the AI reasons over cannot drift apart.

## 1.8.20 (2026-06-25)

- Fix: `edit_element_lines` and `replace_across` now fire the core save events
  (`OnBefore/On{Type}FormSave`) like a normal element update, so **VersionX (and any other
  save-event plugin) creates a version on a line/replace edit** — previously these saved the
  content directly (`$el->save()` / file write) and bypassed the events, so no version was made
  (create and full `update_element` did version, line edits didn't). They now save the full
  field set through the element update processor (content field overridden), and still write the
  static file first for static elements (so the event sees the new content). Token efficiency is
  unchanged — the model still sends only the delta; the server reconstructs and saves properly.

## 1.8.19 (2026-06-23)

- Docs/steering: `getting_started` rewritten around a numbered **recommended workflow**
  (orient → locate → look-before-change/`describe_object` → cheap edits → dry-run destructive →
  verify) so a model that's weak at MODX follows the safe, token-efficient path; `index` help
  landing refreshed to surface `project_overview`, `suggest_tv_type`, `describe_object` and the
  current topics. Helps reduce "which of ~180 tools do I use?" load.

## 1.8.18 (2026-06-23)

- MIGX guide expanded (verified against the MIGX 3.0.2 source): documents `inputTV` — reuse an
  existing TV as a MIGX field's input (for resource pickers limited by parent/template, richtext,
  media, or nested MIGX) instead of hand-writing `@SELECT` — with the required `ForMigx` naming
  convention for those helper TVs (e.g. `listNewsForMigx`). Also clarifies that inline
  `input_properties` (formtabs/columns + optional contextmenus/actionbuttons/columnbuttons/
  filters/extended) is as capable as a named config for TV-stored MIGX, so the inline-only,
  all-JSON workflow is the recommended path (named configs only for cross-TV reuse / MIGXdb).

## 1.8.17 (2026-06-23)

- `suggest_tv_type` — describe a field need (English or Russian) and get ranked candidate TV
  `field_type`s with reasons + a ready-to-edit create_element skeleton (with the extra keys that
  type needs) for the top pick. Deterministic bilingual keyword rules; helps a model unsure about
  MODX pick the right TV type. (group: tv_inputs)
- `list_tv_input_types` now also reports a `colorpicker` custom type when its namespace is
  installed, even if the OnTVInputRenderList event was swallowed (e.g. a broken plugin on it).

## 1.8.16 (2026-06-23)

- MIGX authoring guide (`migx` help doc) rewritten to lead with a complete, copy-pasteable
  INLINE MIGX TV example (a gallery: fields + columns as JSON strings in `input_properties`,
  no separate config object) so a model can build a working MIGX TV on a fresh site without an
  existing config to copy. Field/column reference + the renderChunk gotchas (server-side render,
  `renderchunktpl` key, mandatory virtual `dataIndex`) kept. Verified live: the documented
  example creates a valid `field_type:"migx"` TV end-to-end.

## 1.8.15 (2026-06-23)

- TV authoring guidance (mission: help any model pick the right input type): `list_tv_input_types`
  now returns per-core-type `use` (when to pick it) + `requires` (extra create_element keys like
  elements/media_source); the `tv_input_types` help doc rewritten into a "task → type" decision
  guide with correct examples.
- Robustness: `list_tv_input_types` no longer 500s when a third-party plugin on the manager event
  `OnTVInputRenderList` fatals headlessly (e.g. Ace's `addLexiconTopic() on null`). The event
  invocation is now guarded (Exception + Throwable) — a misbehaving plugin's custom types are
  skipped instead of crashing the action.

## 1.8.14 (2026-06-22)

- `project_overview` — orient on a whole installed site in ONE compact, token-safe call:
  template↔TV map, resource/product COUNTS (overall + by template + by context), a shallow
  resource tree (roots + child counts, capped), element categories, content types, contexts,
  integrations. Scales with structure not content (a 100k-resource site returns the same small
  payload); per-item browsing stays in list_resources / list_elements. `sections` and
  `max_tree_nodes` params; documented as the "orient first" step in getting_started.

## 1.8.13 (baseline)

Capability baseline (history before this point intentionally collapsed). The server exposes a
broad MODX management surface via the MCP client; capability groups are toggled in the CMP
(Components → modxMCP) and enforced server-side.

- **Elements** (chunk/snippet/template/resource/tv/category/plugin): list/get/create/update/
  delete, `make_static`, line-based `view_element` / `edit_element_lines`, `duplicate_element`.
- **Resources**: `list_resources`, `bulk_resources` (publish/unpublish/set_template/move/delete,
  with dry-run), `duplicate_resource`, `reorder_resources`, trash `undelete_resource` /
  `empty_recycle_bin`, `get`/`update_resource_tvs`.
- **Code navigation**: `search_code` (returns match line + line_text), `find_usages`,
  `replace_across` (site-wide, dry-run preview).
- **Media sources**: source CRUD + file/folder ops (create/update/rename/delete file,
  create/delete folder).
- **System settings**, **TV input types**, **components introspection** (read add-on source),
  **describe_object** (xPDO schema).
- **Toggleable groups**: VersionX, VirtualPage, miniShop2, MIGX, Access Control, contexts,
  property sets, package management, namespaces, lexicon.
- **Ops/diagnostics**: `list_actions`, `get_capabilities`, `help` (RAG docs), `clear_cache`,
  `read_audit_log`, `read_error_log`, `refresh_uris`, `remove_locks`, `system_info`,
  `regenerate_token`, `run_processor` (gated).
- **Endpoint**: token auth, optional IP allowlist + HTTPS enforcement, health/version GET.

Versions are kept in sync across `_build/build.config.php`, `package.json`,
`package-lock.json` and `modxMCP::VERSION` (CI-enforced).
